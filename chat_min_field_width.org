*** in c, with printf, what is the "-" flag used for?

In C, when using =printf=, the ='-'= flag is used to left-justify the output within the specified field width. By default, output is right-justified. Here is an example:

#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("|%10s|\n", "text");   // Right-justified within 10 characters
    printf("|%-10s|\n", "text");  // Left-justified within 10 characters
    return 0;
}
#+end_src

This would produce the following output:

#+begin_example
|      text|
|text      |
#+end_example

*** what if there is no field-width given?

If the ='-'= flag is used with =printf= but no field width is specified, it has no effect because there is no minimum field width to left-justify within. The output will be printed as normal. Hereâ€™s an example:

#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    printf("|%s|\n", "text");   // No field width specified
    printf("|%-s|\n", "text");  // '-' flag specified, but no field width
    return 0;
}
#+end_src

Both statements will produce the same result:

#+begin_example
|text|
|text|
#+end_example

*** is the format string itself dependent on the field width?

No, the format string itself is not dependent on the field width. The field width specifies the minimum number of characters to be printed for a given value, and it is independent of the literal text within the format string.

For example:

#+begin_src c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    // No field width specified
    printf("Value: |%s|\n", "text");

    // Field width specified, right-justified
    printf("Value: |%10s|\n", "text");

    // Field width specified, left-justified
    printf("Value: |%-10s|\n", "text");

    return 0;
}
#+end_src

This would produce the following output:

#+begin_example
Value: |text|
Value: |      text|
Value: |text      |
#+end_example

As you can see, the format string "Value: |%s|" remains the same. The field width and alignment (left or right justification) only affect the portion within the format specifier (e.g., =%10s= or =%-10s=).

*** what does aq stand for?
#+begin_example
  A negative field width is  taken as  a \[aq]-\[aq]  flag  followed by  a positive  field width.
#+end_example


In the context of GNU documentation and manuals, =\[aq]= stands for a single quotation mark ('). It is often used in plain text documentation to clearly represent quote characters.

Your example sentence, with =\[aq]= replaced by the single quote character, would read as:

#+begin_example
  A negative field width is taken as a '-' flag followed by a positive field width.
#+end_example
